abstract = {Driver fatigue is a significant risk factor in commercial transportation. Fatigue from combinations of sleep loss, night driving, and prolonged work time contributes substantially to the number of motor vehicle crashes. Over the past decade, driver drowsiness/fatigue has been the subject of intensified Department of Transportation interest and activity; one major initiative has been to explore technology that will enhance commercial motor vehicle (CMV) driver fatigue management. This Tech Brief summarizes an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) study titled Evaluation of Techniques for Ocular Measurement as an Index of Fatigue and as the Basis for Alertness Management. The study was funded in part by FHWAs Office of Motor Carriers and managed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The projects goal was to evaluate the validity and reliability of several drowsiness-detection measures and technologies in a controlled laboratory setting, and to analyze the effects of alerting stimuli on drivers alertness levels. Of the drowsiness-detection measures and technologies evaluated in this study, the measure referred to as PERCLOS was found to be the most reliable and valid determination of a drivers alertness level. PERCLOS is the percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time and reflects slow eyelid closures (droops) rather than blinks. A PERCLOS drowsiness metric was established in a 1994 driving simulator study as the proportion of time in a minute that the eyes are at least 80 percent closed. (Wierwille et al., 1994) Based on research by Wierwille and colleagues (1994), FWHA and NHTSA consider PERCLOS to be among the most promising known real-time measures of alertness for in-vehicle drowsiness-detection systems. The results of this research support the development of a first-ever real-time drowsiness detection sensor that would measure the percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil, over time (i.e., PERCLOS).},

abstract = {Community networks like the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) are presented to vari- ous audiences-the press, potential and current funders, users, civic representatives-via a number of discourses. The dominant discourse used by the developers of the BEV is that of community, one that is inclusive, engaged, and civic-minded. However, when juxta- posing the rhetoric with the historical development and programs of outreach, the notion of community becomes blurred. Although the "Vision Statement" promises free access, civic forums, and a bustling digital public sphere, the implementation of the BEV reveals a highly commercialized agenda. By building an electronic shopping mall under the banner of an electronic town hall, the developers of the BEV represent a legitimate if not somewhat disingenuous precursor to the dot.com craze that followe},
